Manage your project's cron jobs in Node.js

# Purpose
This module allows you to manage the cron jobs related to your application and deploy them easily.

Use Cases:
- I want scheduled jobs to run when my app is deployed but don't want to have to manually setup cron on my server
- I want to manage my cron job configuration in my application so it is backed up in GIT without having to manually do it separately
- I want to have regularly scheduled jobs to execute even if there is a node.js error and my app is down

# Install
```js
$ npm install whenever
```

# Getting Started
```js
$ wheneverize
```

This generates an initial `schedule.js` file.

Setup your cron jobs in `schedule.js`.
